This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### Running your build

Firstly, install the package **serve** globally  
`npm install -g serve` or `yarn global add serve`

Once that's done, serve your build folder  
`serve build`

Finally, you can access your app at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) running in production mode
